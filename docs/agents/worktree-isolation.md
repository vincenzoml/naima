# Worktree isolation

A system requirement, not a preference: every other [flow](../guide/glossary.md#flow) is written to obey
it, and a procedure that violates it is a defect in the procedure. Each rule
below is stated on [the rules page](../guide/rules.md#branches-and-worktrees),
marked enforced or convention; this page says why, and how.

## The five rules

### 1. A worktree writes to its own branch and nowhere else

No tool, flow or session writes into another checkout or commits onto a
branch it is not standing on. **Reading** other branches is fine, and is how
every shared view is built.

### 2. Nobody commits on the trunk while branches are being prepared

A commit on the [trunk](../guide/glossary.md#trunk) while a branch is being prepared destroys that branch's
fast-forward: what was a clean fast-forward becomes a merge over everything
the branch touched. Work in hand goes on a branch:

```sh
naima open <item> --as <who> --name <what>
```

If it happens anyway, move the commit onto the branch and rewind the trunk,
so that git proves the result instead of a merge papering over it:

```sh
git -C <worktree> cherry-pick <sha>     # the commit joins the branch
git reset --keep <sha>^                 # the trunk goes back one; --keep, never --hard
git merge --ff-only <branch>
```

Whether a project allows direct commits on the trunk at all is the [owner](../guide/glossary.md#owner)'s
call; this rule is about not doing it under a branch being prepared.

### 3. Every merge to the trunk is a fast-forward

```sh
git merge --ff-only <branch>
```

**If it fails, stop.** Do not resolve on the trunk, do not `--no-ff`, do not
force. The failure is information: the trunk moved under a branch prepared
against it, and why it moved decides what to do — usually, merge the trunk
into the branch and resolve there (step 6 of
[closing a worktree](closing-a-worktree.md)).

Why: a merge commit hides whether the branch was prepared. `--ff-only`
cannot — it either passes, and the branch was ready, or it refuses before
writing anything. A prepared branch needs nothing but the fast-forward; if it
needs more, the resolution belongs on the branch, where whoever wrote the code
is standing.

### 4. No shared mutable file

Nothing asks two sessions to edit one path to register, announce or log
something: no registry, index, board or "who is doing what" file.

Where a collection is needed: **one file per session, named by a uuid, in a
directory — and the collection is recombined when read.** Naima does this for
its own state:

| Collection | What each session writes | Recombined by |
|---|---|---|
| who is working on what, and who holds each resource | `<tracker>/CLAIMS/<uuid>.json` | `naima claims`, `naima claims --resources`, `naima summary` |
| where each session left off | `<tracker>/PASSES/<date>-<uuid>.md` | `naima pass --list`, `naima summary` |
| an [item](../guide/glossary.md#item)'s place on a board | the item's own `section` field | `naima board` |

The views read every local branch: the trunk, every branch not merged into
it, and whatever each [worktree](../guide/glossary.md#worktree) stands on. A branch checked out in a worktree
is read from that worktree's disk, uncommitted files included — so two
workers' uncommitted claims on one item are seen by each other and by the
trunk — and a file deleted there and not yet committed is gone from every
view. A branch no worktree stands on is read from its ref, as committed.
Remote-tracking refs are not read: a branch that exists only on another
machine is seen once it is fetched and checked out, or merged.

#### Item slugs across branches

Items are directories, `<type>/<slug>/`, so two branches that open an item
with the same title would both write `<type>/<slug>/meta.json` and meet in an
add/add conflict. `naima new` prevents it: before it writes, it reads the
slugs every other local branch holds under that type — from each worktree's
disk, uncommitted items included, or from the branch's ref — and takes the
next free one (`<slug>-2`, …). When the branches cannot all be read (git
fails, or the clone is shallow), the new slug ends in the first eight
characters of the item's uuid instead, which no other branch can pick.

This reduces collisions; it does not remove them. A branch that exists only
on another machine, not yet fetched, is not seen: two such branches can still
pick one slug. Outside git there are no other branches, and nothing is added.

### 5. The smell

> You are about to append a line to a file another session also appends to.

Stop. Make it a directory of uuid-named files.

## What is still allowed

- **Reading any branch.** That is how the views work.
- **Several branches claiming one item.** `naima claim` says who else holds
  it rather than refusing: the point is to know, not to lock.

## The shared-stash hazard

`git stash` is one stack **per repository**, not per worktree: every worktree
shares it. A bare `git stash pop` run in your checkout can apply another
session's stash, landing its half-finished work in your files; a stash taken
just to measure a clean baseline can swap files out from under a process that
is reading them right now.

- **Prefer a temporary WIP commit** over a stash: `git commit -m "WIP: not
  reviewed"`, undone later with `git reset --soft HEAD^` or amended away. A
  commit is yours alone; the stash stack is not.
- **If a stash is unavoidable**, push it with a unique message (`git stash
  push -m "<branch>-<why>"`), apply it by its sha
  (`git stash apply stash@{n}` only right after pushing it, or
  `git apply "$(git stash show -p <sha>)"`), and never bare `pop`. Drop it by
  finding the entry again with the message, not by position — position shifts
  as other sessions push and pop.
- **Never stash to measure a baseline while a resource is running.** A
  baseline is recorded once and read back
  ([closing a worktree](closing-a-worktree.md#5-run-the-gates-and-read-what-breaks)),
  not re-measured by temporarily removing someone else's changes.

## Safety rules

- **A worktree writes to its own branch and nowhere else.** Enforced: no
  command in Naima writes to a path outside the worktree it was invoked in.
- **Nobody commits on the trunk while a branch is being prepared.** Convention
  while `preparing` is unset; checked once set (`naima claim --preparing`,
  [closing a worktree](closing-a-worktree.md#0-say-the-branch-is-being-prepared)).
- **Every merge to the trunk is a fast-forward.** Convention: `git merge
  --ff-only` refuses on its own when it is not one; nothing papers over the
  refusal with `--no-ff` or a force.
- **No shared mutable file.** Convention, kept by the one-file-per-session
  shape above; nothing yet fails a hand-rolled shared log filed outside the
  tracker — candidate property for a later model.
- **Never `git stash pop` in a shared worktree set.** Candidate property for
  a later model: nothing yet checks that a stash was applied by sha rather
  than popped; until then this is read, not verified.
