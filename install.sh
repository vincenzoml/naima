# It clones Naima into naima-tracker/naima/ (a branch or a tag, no temporary
# clone), and runs its `naima init --write-agent-pointer`: that records the
# clone's origin and commit in naima-tracker/naima-data/naima.json, beside it,
# writes the tracker folder's README.md and .gitignore, and points the
# project's agent file at Naima's own. Then it runs `naima check`. Nothing is
# installed globally for Naima; Deno, the one thing Naima needs on the
# machine, is installed with its official installer when it is missing. Run
# again, it says Naima is installed and checks it, cloning the program again
# first when it is missing (at the locked commit, if the clone that holds it
# is gone). On a host installed before the program was a git clone — a copy
# (`naima/.naima-copy.json`) or a clone of the old full repository (its `HEAD`
# holds `naima/src/cli.ts`) — it is moved aside to
# `naima-tracker/.naima-legacy-<date>`, never overwritten, the product is
# cloned fresh, and `naima update` moves the lock to its head and migrates the
# data; the one commit to make is printed. What it does by hand:
# naima/docs/guide/install.md#bootstrap-a-project.
#
#   NAIMA_SOURCE           the repository to clone (default: Naima's on GitHub)
#   NAIMA_REF              the branch or tag to install (default: main)
#   NAIMA_NO_DENO_INSTALL  when set, never install Deno: say how, and stop
