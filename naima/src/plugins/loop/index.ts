// The non-stop loop: agents keep working on an explicit target, chosen before
// starting, until only the owner's work is left on it. `naima loop <target>`
// is what the agent runs on every tick of its wake-up timer: done or not, the
// next agent work, the stop verdict, and — once stopped — the owner's ordered
// action list, each line saying why it is his.
//
// A target is one of three:
//   a work list  an item whose README lists steps as `- [ ]` / `- [x]` lines;
//                a step that cannot be done now carries `deferred: <why>`
//   an epic      an item whose type carries the `group` trait: its items
//   a gate       any gate a plugin contributes: what it still waits for
//
// It stops when every remaining line is deferred, or every remaining item is
// the owner's: a reserved decision, or a proof only a person or a build can
// give. The timer is the harness's; this plugin states its cadence.
