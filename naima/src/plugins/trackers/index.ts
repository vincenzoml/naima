const ABOUT = `Three words that are not synonyms:

- **fixed** — the code change exists: \`fixedOn\` is set. Nothing is proven.
- **resolved** — fixed, and proven by an item that \`verifies\` it and whose status \`proves\` (a passed test, a property that holds).
- **closed** — resolved, and moved to \`closed/\` by \`naima close\`, carrying its proof.

"How many bugs are left" means the unfixed count; \`naima bugs\` never adds the three together.

\`fixedOn\` applies to every type tagged \`fixable\` — bugs, todos, features and the archive here, and any other plugin's or project's type that carries the tag.

An item whose proof needs a person says why in \`humanBecause\`. Only a judgement, a reserved decision, a credential or a physical act makes something a person's: needing the running software makes it \`agent-hands\`, not \`human\`.

## The evidence ranking

Not all evidence is worth the same. From strongest to weakest, the values of a test's \`evidenceKind\`:

${EVIDENCE.map(([k, says], n) => `${n + 1}. \`${k}\` — ${says}`).join("\n")}

No number without its comparison: a count, a timing or a size proves something only beside the value it is compared with — before and after, expected and seen.

A regression test is one that \`verifies\` a bug. It proves the fix only if it was seen failing first, on the code before the fix: red, then green. \`redSeen\` records the day it was seen red, and the page's notes say how. \`naima check\` notes a passed regression test with no \`redSeen\`, and a passed test whose evidence is \`inspection\`.

## Stale pages

A page can outlive its answer. Two notes, never failures, find it: an open item's unticked \`- [ ]\` clause that names a test which has since passed, as \`tests/<slug>\` or as "the linked test" once every item verifying it has passed — \`unticked-clause-names-passed-test\`; and an open test marked \`runBy: agent\` whose page, below its title, excuses it with a resource being held — \`test-excuses-itself\`, matching the phrases in the option \`excusePhrases\`. Each can be weighed, or switched off, under \`plugins.trackers.checks\`.`
