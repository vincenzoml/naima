// A trivial adapter that shows the shape of a real one. The "model" is any
// text file and the property is one of:
//
//   some <regex>    holds when at least one line matches
//   never <regex>   holds when no line matches; the first match is the counterexample
//
// A line `#include <path>` stands for the lines of that file, the path taken
// from the including file's directory: the adapter's inputs are the model and
// every file it includes, so a change to an included file makes a verdict
// stale, as a real tool's includes would.
//
// A real adapter (mCRL2, VoxLogicA) runs the tool, maps its exit status and
// output to a verdict, and returns the trace it printed.
