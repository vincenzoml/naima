// The mCRL2 toolset this plugin needs, pinned to release 202607.0, as `naima
// tools install mcrl2` installs it (specs/tools-plugin-declares-tools-needs-naima-tools,
// §8). The sizes and sha256 are the release's own, as GitHub publishes them for
// https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2/releases/tag/mcrl2-202607.0.
//
// The tools point belongs to the tools plugin, and plugins never import each
// other: the shape is the one its contract declares.
